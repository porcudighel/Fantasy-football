# Fantasy-football
R code to predict best players available
Based on dataframes from fantagazzetta.com (imported from local file into DF dati201819) and legaseriea.it (imported from website into DF LSA)
Merging the two dataframes into DF FGandLSA
Import list of avialable players for the league Fantavanzago (DF svincolati) and of player of my team (Atletico Porcao, DF AtlPorcao)
from local files, and get the stats found in FGandLSA for them (DF liberi and StatsAP respectively)
Play around with the stats, selecting available players perfoming better than mine (but that depends a lot on the chosen KPI)
